**Django** is a **high-level, full-stack Python web framework** designed for building secure, scalable, and maintainable web applications quickly.

* It follows the **MVT architecture (Model–View–Template)**.
* Comes with **a lot of built-in features** (database handling, authentication, admin panel, security, etc.).
* Its motto is **“The web framework for perfectionists with deadlines”** ⏳.

## 🔹 Why Django?

* 🏗️ **Batteries included** → ORM, authentication, forms, sessions, admin panel.
* 🔒 **Secure** → Protects against SQL injection, CSRF, XSS, etc.
* 🚀 **Scalable** → Used by Instagram, Spotify, YouTube (initially).
* ⚡ **Rapid development** → Build apps fast with less boilerplate.
* 🌐 **Community & ecosystem** → Huge set of third-party packages.

## 🔹 Django Architecture (MVT Pattern)

* **Model** → Handles database (data layer).
* **View** → Contains business logic (controller).
* **Template** → Defines the user interface (HTML, frontend).

## 🔹 Simple Example

`views.py`

```python
from django.http import HttpResponse

def home(request):
    return HttpResponse("Hello, Django!")
```

`urls.py`

```python
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path("", views.home, name="home"),
]
```

Run server:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Now visit 👉 `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` → **Hello, Django!** 🎉

## 🔹 Django vs Flask vs FastAPI

| Feature           | **Django**              | **Flask**            | **FastAPI**                  |
| ----------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Type              | Full-stack              | Microframework       | API-focused                  |
| Built-in features | ORM, Admin, Auth, Forms | Minimal              | Validation, async, auto-docs |
| Best for          | Large, complex apps     | Small to medium apps | APIs & ML model serving      |
| Learning curve    | Medium-high             | Easy                 | Medium                       |
