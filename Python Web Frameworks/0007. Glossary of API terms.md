## 🔹 Important API Terms

### 1. **API (Application Programming Interface)**

A set of rules that allows two applications to communicate with each other.
👉 Example: A weather API lets your app fetch today’s temperature.

---

### 2. **API Endpoint**

The specific **URL** where an API resource is accessible.
👉 Example: `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=London`
(Here, `/weather` is the endpoint).

---

### 3. **REST API (Representational State Transfer)**

A popular architectural style for designing APIs. Uses **HTTP methods** (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to interact with resources (data).
👉 Example:

* `GET /users` → fetch all users
* `POST /users` → create a new user

---

### 4. **HTTP Methods**

* **GET** → Retrieve data
* **POST** → Create new data
* **PUT/PATCH** → Update existing data
* **DELETE** → Remove data

---

### 5. **Request**

The message a client sends to the API, usually containing:

* Method (GET/POST, etc.)
* URL/endpoint
* Headers (metadata like authentication token)
* Body (for sending data, e.g., JSON)

---

### 6. **Response**

The message the API sends back, usually with:

* **Status code** (200 OK, 404 Not Found, 500 Server Error)
* **Headers** (metadata)
* **Body** (data, often JSON)

---

### 7. **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)**

The most common format for sending/receiving data in APIs.
👉 Example:

```json
{
  "name": "Bharath",
  "age": 25
}
```

---

### 8. **Authentication**

Verifying the identity of a user/system calling the API.

* **API Key** → simple token for access
* **OAuth 2.0** → secure industry-standard protocol
* **JWT (JSON Web Token)** → token-based authentication

---

### 9. **Rate Limiting**

Restricting the number of API calls a client can make in a certain time.
👉 Example: “Max 1000 requests per hour.”

---

### 10. **Idempotency**

Means making the same request multiple times has the **same effect**.
👉 Example: `DELETE /user/1` → removing user 1 is always the same, even if called twice.

---

### 11. **Versioning**

APIs evolve, so versions are maintained to avoid breaking old apps.
👉 Example:

* `api.example.com/v1/users`
* `api.example.com/v2/users`

---

### 12. **Webhooks**

Reverse APIs → instead of you calling the API, the API **calls your app** when something happens.
👉 Example: Payment gateway notifies your system after a successful payment.

---

### 13. **GraphQL (vs REST)**

Another API style where the client specifies exactly what data it needs in a single query.
👉 Example: Instead of multiple endpoints, one endpoint returns customized data.

---

### 14. **SDK (Software Development Kit)**

A collection of tools/libraries to simplify API usage in a specific language.
👉 Example: Twilio Python SDK for sending SMS.

---

### 15. **Swagger / OpenAPI**

Standards for documenting APIs. Tools like Swagger UI provide **interactive docs**.
