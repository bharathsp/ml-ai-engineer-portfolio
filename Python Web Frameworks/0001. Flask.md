**Flask** is a **lightweight web framework** for Python.

* It’s called a **microframework** because it provides only the essentials (routing, request/response handling) and lets you add extra features (database, authentication, etc.) with extensions.
* It’s very flexible and simple to start with, making it one of the most popular Python frameworks for web apps and APIs.

## 🔹 Why Flask?

* 🪶 **Lightweight** → Comes with only the basics.
* 🛠️ **Flexible** → Add only what you need (ORM, forms, security, etc.).
* 📝 **Simple** → Easy to learn, great for beginners.
* 🚀 **Widely used** → Good choice for quick APIs, prototypes, and even production apps.

## 🔹 How Flask works (Simple Example)

`app.py`

```python
from flask import Flask

# Create a Flask app
app = Flask(__name__)

# Define a route
@app.route("/")
def home():
    return "Hello, Flask!"

# Another route with parameter
@app.route("/hello/<name>")
def hello(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
```

👉 Run:

```bash
python app.py
```

Now open in browser:

* `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` → `Hello, Flask!`
* `http://127.0.0.1:5000/hello/Bharath` → `Hello, Bharath!`

## 🔹 Real-life Use Cases

* Build **REST APIs** for mobile/web apps.
* Serve **machine learning models**.
* Quick **prototyping** of web apps.
* Small-to-medium **websites**.

---

## 🔹 Flask vs FastAPI vs Django

* **Flask** → Minimal, flexible, add what you want.
* **FastAPI** → Modern, async, fast, auto-docs (great for APIs).
* **Django** → Full-featured framework with everything built-in (ORM, admin, auth).

---

✅ **In short:**
Flask = A **simple, flexible web framework** for Python, great for building quick APIs or small web apps.
