# 👨‍💻 Who is an ML/AI Engineer?

An **ML (Machine Learning) or AI Engineer** is someone who **designs, builds, and deploys machine learning models into production**.

* They **bridge the gap** between Data Scientists (who research & experiment with models) and Data Engineers (who build scalable data infrastructure).
* They focus on making models **production-ready, scalable, and efficient**.

## 🔹 1. Strengthen ML & AI Fundamentals

As a Data Engineer, you already handle data pipelines, so the first step is to learn how **data is used in ML**.

* **Key Topics:**

  * Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning
  * Regression, Classification, Clustering
  * Feature Engineering & Feature Scaling
  * Overfitting, Cross-validation, Regularization
* **Tools:**

  * **Scikit-learn** (for classical ML)
  * **Pandas + NumPy** (for data manipulation)

📘 Learn from: *Andrew Ng’s ML Course (Coursera)* or *Fast.ai*
