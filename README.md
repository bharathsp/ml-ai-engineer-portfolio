# AI/ML Engineer Repository ðŸš€

This repository contains resources, projects, and best practices related to **taking machine learning models from development to production**, optimizing them for speed, scalability, and cost, and maintaining them using MLOps practices.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Overview

As an AI/ML Engineer, my focus is on bridging the gap between **Data Science** and **production deployment**, ensuring that ML models deliver real-world value efficiently. This includes:

- Productionizing ML models from Data Scientists
- Optimizing models for performance, scalability, and cost
- Deploying models via APIs, batch jobs, or streaming pipelines
- Monitoring model performance and handling model drift
- Implementing MLOps practices for **CI/CD of ML workflows**

---

## ðŸ”¹ Model Development (with Data Scientists)

Collaborate with Data Scientists to:

- Select appropriate algorithms
- Tune hyperparameters for optimal performance
- Perform feature engineering
- Validate models before deployment

---

## ðŸ”¹ Model Deployment

Deploy models in production using:

- **REST APIs**, batch jobs, or real-time streaming systems
- **Containerization:** Docker  
- **Orchestration:** Kubernetes  
- **Cloud ML services:** AWS SageMaker, GCP AI Platform, Azure ML

---

## ðŸ”¹ MLOps (Machine Learning Operations)

Automate ML pipelines to ensure reliability and scalability:

- Automate training, testing, and deployment pipelines
- Implement **CI/CD for ML workflows** using:
  - GitHub Actions
  - MLflow
  - Kubeflow
  - Airflow (optional)

---

## ðŸ”¹ Monitoring & Maintenance

Maintain deployed models by:

- Tracking model performance (accuracy, precision, recall)
- Detecting **data or model drift**
- Retraining or updating models when required
- Logging predictions and metrics for continuous improvement

---

## ðŸ”¹ Collaboration

Work closely with:

- **Data Engineers** for robust data pipelines  
- **Data Scientists** for model design, feature selection, and validation  
- **DevOps/Cloud teams** for deployment and infrastructure
