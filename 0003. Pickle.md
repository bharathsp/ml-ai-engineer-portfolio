## 🔹 What is **Pickle** in Python?

**Pickle** is a **built-in Python module** used for **serializing and deserializing objects**.

* **Serialization (pickling)** → Converting a Python object into a byte stream (so it can be saved to a file or sent over a network).
* **Deserialization (unpickling)** → Converting that byte stream back into a Python object.

Think of it like **freezing an object** 🥶 into a file, and later **defrosting it** 🍲 back into memory.

## 🔹 How Pickle works (Example)

```python
import pickle

# A Python dictionary
data = {"name": "Bharath", "age": 25, "skills": ["Python", "ML", "SQL"]}

# Serialize (save to file)
with open("data.pkl", "wb") as f:
    pickle.dump(data, f)

# Deserialize (load from file)
with open("data.pkl", "rb") as f:
    loaded_data = pickle.load(f)

print(loaded_data)
```

✅ This saves the dictionary to `data.pkl` and reloads it later exactly as it was.

## 🔹 When to use Pickle

* Save Python objects like lists, dicts, or custom classes.
* Store small ML models (works but not always efficient).
* Temporary caching of Python objects.

## 🔹 Limitations of Pickle

⚠️ **Not secure** → Unpickling data from untrusted sources can execute malicious code.
⚠️ **Not cross-language** → Pickled objects can only be read by Python, not by Java, C++, etc.
⚠️ **Less efficient** for large numpy arrays/ML models → That’s why libraries like **Joblib** are preferred.

✅ **Quick comparison:**

* **Pickle** → General-purpose Python object storage.
* **Joblib** → Optimized for **large numerical data & ML models**.
