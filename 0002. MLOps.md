## **1️⃣ What is MLOps?**

**MLOps (Machine Learning Operations)** is like **DevOps but for ML models**.
It’s a set of practices that **combine Machine Learning, DevOps, and Data Engineering** to **deploy, monitor, and maintain ML models in production reliably and efficiently**.

**Key idea:** ML model development is different from software development because models **learn from data**, so the workflow needs **automation, monitoring, and version control for both code and data**.

**Real-world analogy:**
Think of **MLOps as a bakery production line**:

* Raw ingredients → dough → baked bread → quality check → delivery to stores.
  Similarly:
* Raw data → preprocessing → train model → validate → deploy → monitor → update.

## **3️⃣ Popular MLOps Tools**

**1. Data Management & Versioning**

* **Tools:** DVC, MLflow, Delta Lake, Pachyderm
* **Analogy:** Ingredient storage & labeling to know which batch is which.

**2. Model Training & Experiment Tracking**

* **Tools:** MLflow, Weights & Biases, TensorBoard
* **Analogy:** Logging baking experiments to track which recipe works best.

**3. Model Deployment**

* **Tools:** Kubernetes, Docker, Sagemaker, TensorFlow Serving, TorchServe
* **Analogy:** Shipping bread to stores using proper packaging and vehicles.

**4. Monitoring & Feedback**

* **Tools:** Prometheus, Grafana, Evidently AI, Fiddler
* **Analogy:** Check how customers like the bread and if shelves are empty.

**5. Automation / CI/CD for ML**

* **Tools:** Jenkins, GitHub Actions, Airflow, Kubeflow Pipelines
* **Analogy:** Conveyor belt that ensures bread keeps moving from oven to store automatically.
